### No-Bake Cheesecake Flag Cake

This recipe is for a delicious and festive no-bake cheesecake cake that's perfect for any occasion. The cake is made with a graham cracker crust, a creamy cheesecake filling, and a topping of fresh strawberries and blueberries arranged in the colors of the American flag.

**Tips:**

- For a more intense chocolate flavor, use dark chocolate cocoa powder.
- If you don't have a 9x11-inch baking dish, you can use a 9-inch round cake pan. Just be sure to adjust the baking time accordingly.
- You can use any type of berries you like for the topping. Blueberries and strawberries are traditional, but raspberries, blackberries, and even cherries would be delicious.
- This cake can be made ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
- Enjoy! 🇺🇸 🍰
